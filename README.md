Wilsonic MTS-ESP is an advanced audio plugin and standalone application for creative sound design and music production. It tunes up the software synthesizers in your DAW via MTS-ESP to the scale designs of Erv Wilson; it has a simple synth that you can use to confirm your synths are all in tune.  The Wilsonic Controller target outputs MIDI, while also tuning up all soft synths in your DAW via MTS-ESP.  You can use WilsonicController to perform on generalized keyboard layouts

## Design Philosophy

Wilsonic MTS-ESP is designed to enable professional music production with microtonal scale designs by Erv Wilson in the DAW of your choice, where all the parameters to the scale design are automatable in the DAW.  See [parameters](./daw_automated_params.txt) for a list of the parameters that can be automated.

The source of truth for all state is therefore JUCE's AudioProcessorValueTreeState.  The Processor owns the APVTS and all Models.  The Model objects own the Tuning objects, and bind them to APVTS, and provide an interface for the UI objects.  The Tuning objects are responsible for generating the MTS-ESP data.  Tuning objects know how to draw themselves.  Components delegate drawing to the Model objects, which pass the drawing on to the Tuning objects.  

The Editor is only responsible for rendering the UI, which is implemented as a LookAndFeel and Component hierarchy.  The Editor is not guaranteed to ever be created.
