# Experiment log — lattice (melody ⇄ lattice ⇄ harmony)

Format: hypothesis → result → kept/reverted. Entry written BEFORE each run.
This is the **lattice module's own notebook**, deliberately separate from
`experiments/triads/LOG.md` so the two workstreams never fight over the same
append-only file. Same discipline, different file. Findings promoted to
`experiments/lattice/FINDINGS.md`; receipts under `experiments/lattice/results/`.

The contract is `experiments/lattice/SPEC.md` (hypotheses, tolerances, design
decisions, primary-source citations). Execution order: SPEC.md §"Order of
execution".

## Scorer baselines

- **Frozen triad scorer**: `experiments/triads/scorer.py` **v1.1.0**, unchanged
  by this module (SPEC.md freeze-compliance clause). Anything scored with the
  frozen scorer here — e.g. BRIDGE-000's D'Alessandro harmonic-fidelity
  measurement, `.scl` ear-check exports — is a **v1.1.0** measurement (triads
  counted within a single octave; the ear-validated regime). Do not mix with
  pre-2026-07-24 v1.0.0 numbers.
- **Melodic scorer**: `experiments/lattice/melodic.py`, versioned
  independently, starts at **v0.1.0**; freeze (hash-pin pattern) after Marcus
  reviews LAT-MEL-001.

## 2026-07-24 — coordination: branch brought current to scorer v1.1.0

**Context (not a run):** this branch forked from `16a7913` (triads LOOP-001)
when the frozen scorer was v1.0.0. The triads session then landed v1.1.0 (PR
#14 → `main`): triads must now fit **within an octave**, an ear-validated
change that re-ranks results and drops ~25–30% of prior counts. Scoring the
lattice queue against v1.0.0 would have produced numbers incomparable with the
current frozen scorer and with any future triads work.

**Action:** merged `origin/main` into this branch (non-destructive merge, not a
rebase, since the branch is pushed and lives in a worktree). Clean merge, no
conflicts; `scorer.py` now v1.1.0 with its pin intact, harness suite 88/88.
`experiments/lattice/SPEC.md` preserved. No lattice code written yet, so there
were no stale lattice receipts to regenerate.

**Kept.** Every lattice receipt from here records scorer 1.1.0.

## 2026-07-25 — melodic.py v0.1.0: M1/M2/M3 scorers + unit tests

**Hypothesis (pre-run):** the three melodic scorers specced in SPEC.md
§"Melodic scorers" can be implemented as pure functions of a cents
pitch-class multiset and will reproduce the SPEC's expected unit-test
outcomes: 12-EDO diatonic (proper, CS, 2 gaps), 12-EDO whole-tone (strictly
proper, 1 gap), Pythagorean [wolf] 12 (improper), random 6-note (high gap
entropy).

**Design decisions (logged before the run):**
- Canonical form delegates to the frozen scorer's `canonical_cents_scale`
  (read-only import, scorer v1.1.0) so both axes agree on what "the scale"
  is; dedup ε default 0.01¢ per SPEC (scorer's own default is 1e-6¢).
- Clustering (M1 gaps, M2 interval sizes): sorted values, new cluster when
  value − cluster_minimum > ε. Anchored to the cluster MINIMUM, not the
  previous value — no unbounded chaining; deterministic.
- M1 entropy reported in BITS (base 2); the SPEC's "entropy ≤ log 2" for
  MOS reads as ≤ 1 bit.
- M2 machine check: spans 1..N−1, all N·(N−1) circular intervals; a size
  class at ≥2 distinct spans is one violation. Val lens (exact rationals
  only): patent val for the scale's actual prime limit, ±1 per odd-prime
  coordinate, FULL product (3^k vals, logged); Kendall tau = discordant
  pair count, ties recorded separately, deterministic first-minimum wins.
- M3 comparisons use ε_prop = 1e-9¢ as a float-noise guard only; equality
  within ε_prop blocks strictness, not propriety.

**Result (goldens hand-derived while pinning, then suite executed):** two
SPEC parentheticals are FALSE and are corrected in the pinned tests:
1. 12-EDO diatonic is NOT a constant structure — the 600¢ tritone subtends
   3 steps (F–B) and 4 steps (B–F′): exactly one violating class. (It IS
   proper-but-not-strict via the max-span-3 = min-span-4 = 600¢ equality.)
   Pythagorean diatonic and Pythagorean 12 ARE CS (611.73 vs 588.27¢ split
   cleanly at ε_CS = 0.5¢) — CS-ness here is a JI-vs-tempering distinction,
   a nice first sanity signal for the melodic axis.
2. Pythagorean [wolf] 12 is STRICTLY PROPER (apotome/limma runs never cross
   spans; zero violations, zero equalities). The known-improper fixture is
   the Pythagorean DIATONIC 7 — aug4 611.73¢ at 3 steps > dim5 588.27¢ at
   4 steps, Rothenberg's classic example. Tests pin the machine-checked
   truth for both scales.
Suite: experiments/lattice/tests/test_melodic.py, run recorded below.

**Kept.** melodic.py v0.1.0 as implemented; SPEC.md §"Melodic scorers"
parentheticals stand corrected by machine check (SPEC text left untouched —
it is the historical contract; corrections live here, in the module
docstring, and in the pinned tests). Not yet frozen: freeze follows
Marcus's LAT-MEL-001 review per SPEC.

**Run receipt:** 2026-07-25, python3.12 — lattice suite 25/25 OK; triads
suite re-run 88/88 OK; scorer freeze check A OK (pin 1a840af9…9b592
unchanged). No receipts under results/ yet — this entry gates the first
LAT-MEL-001 run.

## 2026-07-28 — SHADOW-001 pre-registration (entry written BEFORE any run)

**Experiment:** comma perturbation of CPS factors, SPEC.md §SHADOW-001.
Implementation `experiments/lattice/shadow001.py`; receipts to
`experiments/lattice/results/shadow001.jsonl` (one row per variant) plus a
verdict summary `results/shadow001_verdicts.json`.

**Sweep definition (fixed before run):** bases hexany = CPS(4,2) of
(1,3,5,7) and eikosany = CPS(6,3) of (1,3,5,7,9,11). For each factor
position, for k ∈ 3..16, for sign ∈ {+, −}: replace factor n with
m = 2^k·n ± 1, one perturbed factor at a time; skip a variant iff m
collides with another factor of the set. Predicted skips: hexany
(n=1, k=3, −) → m=7; eikosany (n=1, k=3, ±) → m ∈ {9, 7}. Expected rows:
4·14·2 − 1 = 111 hexany + 6·14·2 − 2 = 166 eikosany variants + 2
unperturbed baselines = 279.

**Epsilons (all logged per row):** frozen scorer v1.1.0 on BOTH paths —
`score()` exact-rational (control) and `score_tempered(cents,
epsilon_cents=2.0)` (H-S1's recovery prediction lives here); both at the
frozen default max_span (triads within an octave). Tone survival:
`canonical_cents_scale` dedup at ε_dedup ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 2}¢ on the
exact-canonical scale's cents. Comma spectrum: all pairwise circular
intervals < 20¢. Melodic M1–M3 via `melodic.score_melodic_rational`
defaults (dedup 0.01¢, gap 0.5¢, CS 0.5¢, propriety 1e-9¢), melodic
v0.1.0. Displacement recorded exactly as
1200·|log2((2^k·n ± 1)/(2^k·n))| ≈ 1731.234/(2^k·n) cents.

**H-S1 (quoted from SPEC):** "exact-coincidence triads DROP relative to
the unperturbed CPS for small k (the comma breaks alignment with the
1-products), and recover discontinuously when the displacement falls
inside scorer ε (predicted threshold between k=8 and k=12 for n=1)."
Numeric pre-registration: (a) exact path is the control — for every
variant, exact score_min < the base's exact score_min at k = 3..7, and NO
recovery at k = 16 (exact coincidences, once broken, stay broken; any
exact recovery would have to come from new shared-factor coincidences,
H-S3's territory, not from k growing). Hexany base exact predicted (8,8)
per SPEC §BRIDGE-001; eikosany base measured at run time. (b) tempered
path at ε = 2¢: recovery k* := min k with variant tempered score_min ≥
base tempered score_min satisfies displacement(k*) < 2¢, i.e. predicted
k* per perturbed factor n: n=1 → 10 (disp 1.691¢; k=9 is 3.380¢),
n=3 → 9 (1.127¢), n=5 → 8 (1.353¢), n=7 → 7 (1.932¢), n=9 → 7 (1.503¢),
n=11 → 7 (1.230¢). The n=1 prediction (k*=10) sits inside SPEC's
"between k=8 and k=12".

**H-S2 (quoted from SPEC):** "there is a sharp k* where dedup behavior
snaps (tone count changes); k* shifts by exactly 1 per doubling of
ε_dedup." Numeric pre-registration: IF the collapse mechanism exists
(i.e. some surviving tone sits at the perturbed tone's unperturbed pitch
class, distance ≈ displacement), then k*(n, ε) = min k with
1731.234/(2^k·n) < ε: for n=1 that is k* = 10 (ε=2¢), 12 (0.5¢),
15 (0.1¢), 18 (0.01¢ — outside the sweep, prediction: no collapse seen);
ε 0.5→2¢ is two doublings ⇒ shift of exactly 2. Pre-registered mechanism
caveat (falsifiable the other way): hand analysis finds NO zero-distance
mixed pair in either base (the 20 eikosany products are 20 distinct odd
numbers; no 2-subproduct is octave-equivalent to a surviving 3-product),
so the strict mechanism may be absent ⇒ alternative outcome is tone
count CONSTANT in k at every ε ≤ 2¢ (H-S2 refuted on these bases), with
possible non-monotone collapse windows where a displaced tone transits a
close neighbor (e.g. 385/384-type pairs, 4.503¢). Either outcome is a
finding; the comma-spectrum receipts adjudicate.

**H-S3 (quoted from SPEC):** "composite perturbations that share factors
with the base set (e.g. 255 sharing 3, 5) yield higher triad counts than
prime perturbations of comparable size (e.g. 257) — 'connectivity beats
pure novelty.'" Numeric pre-registration: matched pairs = same (base,
position, k), sign + vs −, where exactly one of the two m is a
sharing composite (gcd of its odd part with the remaining factors'
primes > 1) and the other is prime. Test on the exact path (the only
path where "coincidence" is exact): sharing side wins (exact P strictly
greater) in ≥ 2/3 of matched pairs. Report win/tie/loss counts and the
same tally for tempered score_min at ε=2 as a secondary lens.

**Auxiliary structural check (pre-registered):** P = S exactly for EVERY
variant on both paths' guarded counts — CPS(n, n/2) inversional symmetry
is seed-value-independent, and the anchored scorer commutes with
inversion (triads/FINDINGS.md). Any P ≠ S row is a bug in the harness,
not a finding.

**Determinism:** stdlib only, fixed constants above, no randomness;
timestamps and git commit recorded as provenance only.

## 2026-07-28 — SHADOW-001 results + verdicts

**Receipts:** `results/shadow001.jsonl` (279 rows: 2 baselines + 111
hexany + 166 eikosany variants, exactly as pre-registered, including the
three predicted collision skips) and `results/shadow001_verdicts.json`.
Scorer v1.1.0 both paths, melodic v0.1.0, all epsilons as pre-registered.
Two identical runs (deterministic); ~6 s wall clock.

**Baselines (measured):** hexany exact (6,6) / tempered ε=2 (6,6);
eikosany exact (57,57) / tempered (61,61). The SPEC §BRIDGE-001 "(8,8)"
for the hexany is the v1.0.0 no-span number (verified:
`score(s, max_span=None)` = (8,8)); under v1.1.0's within-octave rule two
octahedron-face triads exceed the span, giving (6,6) — consistent with
the anchored block of `triads/results/hex001.jsonl`. Neither base has any
pairwise interval below 20¢ (both comma spectra empty).

**H-S1 — CONFIRMED (both clauses), one pre-registered exception class.**
Exact control: 38/39 hexany and 58/58 eikosany small-k (3..7) variants
drop strictly below base; ZERO exact recoveries at k=16. The single
non-drop is the sharing jackpot m=15=3·5 (n=1, k=4, −), which restores
exact (6,6) at 111.7¢ displacement — H-S3's mechanism, exactly the
carve-out pre-registered. Exact counts settle to k-independent floors:
hexany 1/0/3/4 for perturbed n=1/3/5/7 (perturbing 3 kills EVERY exact
triad of the hexany; see finding below), eikosany 22/18/27/32/25/41 for
n=1/3/5/7/9/11. Tempered path: sustained recovery k*_sust (post-hoc lens
added after first inspection, labeled in shadow001.py — the
pre-registered first-crossing detector is jackpot-contaminated) matches
the pre-registered k* in 16/20 configs and sits inside scorer ε in
19/20; n=1 recovers at exactly k=10 on both bases and both signs, inside
SPEC's "between k=8 and k=12". The four deviations are ±1-count jitter
around base (60 vs 61) at sub-cent displacements plus ONE outside-ε
early crossing: eikosany n=11 +, k=6, m=705=3·5·47 (sharing), disp
2.457¢. Verdict: kept.

**H-S1 surprise — tempered OVERSHOOT.** 52 eikosany variants score
ABOVE base tempered (up to 69 and 67 vs 61; e.g. n=7 −, k=7, disp
1.93¢), concentrated where displacement is ~0.2–2¢, decaying to exactly
base by k≈12–14. Shadow tones just inside ε satisfy near-coincidences
the unperturbed tone cannot — perturbation at the ε boundary is
temporarily WORTH TEMPERED TRIADS. The hexany never overshoots (0/111).

**H-S2 — REFUTED as pre-registered; the pre-registered mechanism caveat
is what happened.** ε_dedup was inert across the ENTIRE sweep: in all
279 rows the deduped tone count equals the exact tone count at every
ε ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 2}¢ — no near-merge anywhere, hence no k*, hence
no shift-per-doubling. Root cause exactly as cautioned: no mixed pair
sits near zero distance, and the smallest comma produced anywhere in the
sweep is 2.912¢ (595/594, eikosany n=1 k=4 +) > the largest ε_dedup 2¢.
Tone counts DO change — but only by EXACT rational collision,
ε-independent and confined to small k on the eikosany: m=15 → 18 tones
({15,3,7}={5,7,9}=315, {15,3,11}={5,9,11}=495), m=33 → 18
({33,3,5}=495, {33,3,7}={7,9,11}=693), m=55 (n=7, k=3, −) → 18
({55,1,3}={3,5,11}=165, {55,1,9}={5,9,11}=495). Dedup "snapping" on
these bases is lattice arithmetic, not epsilon geometry. Verdict:
reverted (hypothesis falsified; finding promoted).

**H-S3 — CONFIRMED, unanimous direction.** 57 matched ±pairs (25 hexany,
32 eikosany) with one sharing-composite and one prime side. Exact path:
sharing wins 11, ties 46, prime wins 0 — the sharing side NEVER loses
(one-sided sign test vs even odds: p = 2⁻¹¹ ≈ 0.0005). Hexany:
15 vs 17 at k=4 gives exact P 6 vs 2. Eikosany wins cluster at small k
(m small ⇒ heavy factor overlap); at large k both sides hit the same
surviving-triad floor (ties). Jewel: the matched pair (n=3, k=7) is
385 = 5·7·11 vs prime 383 — replacing 3 with 385/128 is literally a
385/384 shift (4.503¢), one of BRIDGE-000's three D'Alessandro kernel
commas — and it wins exact P 24 vs 18. The tempered lens at ε=2 does NOT
track connectivity (13W/1T/18L, noise from the overshoot effect above);
"connectivity beats pure novelty" is an EXACT-path statement. Verdict:
kept.

**Auxiliary check:** P = S in all 279 rows on both paths (guarded
counts) — CPS(n, n/2) inversional symmetry survives arbitrary factor
replacement, as pre-registered.

**Exploratory (H-L3 preview, not pre-registered):** eikosany n=3 +
sweep: M2 CS violations go base 32 → 18 in the 1–5¢ displacement region
(BETTER than base) → back to 31–32 once displacement < ε_CS = 0.5¢
(k ≥ 12). The restoration threshold tracks ε_CS as H-L4/H-L3 predict,
and the mid-k IMPROVEMENT (a comma-sized perturbation melodically
cleans up the eikosany) is unexpected — queued as a LAT-MEL-001/H-L3
follow-up, not claimed as a finding yet (single-config observation).

**Run receipt:** 2026-07-28, python3.12 — lattice suite 37/37 OK
(25 melodic + 12 new shadow001 helper tests), triads suite 88/88 OK,
scorer freeze check A OK (pin 1a840af9…9b592 unchanged).
